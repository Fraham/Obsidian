[Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ec2_transit_gateway_route_table_propagation)

A propagation is what links a [[Transit Gateway - Attachment]] to a [[Transit Gateway - Route Table]] as a destination of traffic. This tells the [[Transit Gateway]] which routes are valid in the route table. An attachment can be propagated to multiple route tables.

A propagation handles the creation of the [[Transit Gateway - Route Table - Route]]s.
